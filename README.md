Lessons for training cGans with embedding
Using work inspired by Jason Brownlee and Jeff Heaton, I demonstrate a cGAN with the following characteristics:
  1.  automatically recover from poor initialization
  2.  recovery from incomplete convergence
  3.  use of non-random initialization values
  4.  testing source material (original pictures of faces)
  5.  over-riding warning messages

Words of caution:
  1.  this is not rocket science
  2.  I do not significantly expand our knowledge of Generative Adversarial Networks
  
Motivation:
In my efforts to learn Generative Adversarial Networks, I got tired of so many efforts related to GAN where the author appeared to be completing something for a class project and, with a wave of a hand, would declare something to be complete and working when, in fact, it neither worked nor was it complete.  The other were projects where the code presented was obviously wrong, in error, and had little to do with the output which was promised and illustrated.
